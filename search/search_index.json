Browser Support The recommended browser for use with web\u042fcade on a Mac is Google Chrome due to its extensive gamepad compatibility and minimal configuration. The Safari web browser is also compatible but supports fewer gamepads and additional steps are required to achieve an optimal experience ( see below ). Chrome Chrome is the recommended browser for web\u042fcade when playing on a Mac due to its extensive support for gamepads as well as its minimal configuration. Full Screen Chrome can be set to \"full screen mode\" by opening the View menu in the Chrome menu bar and selecting the Enter Full Screen menu item. By default, \"full screen mode\" displays the navigation toolbar which contains the current URL and navigation buttons (See image below). To remove the navigation toolbar in \"full screen mode\" open the View menu in the Chrome menu bar and unselect the Always Show Toolbar in Full Screen menu item (see image below).

It is important to note that while web\u042fcade is functional on previous generations of Xbox One consoles, there will most likely be significant performance issues. Note Support for web\u042fcade on Xbox Series X|S is based on the Xbox Edge browser that utilizes EdgeHTML as its engine. The Xbox Edge browser will be switching to Blink as its browser engine (part of Chromium) in the near future (currently in preview). It is not clear what the impact of the switch to Blink will be on web\u042fcade. It is entirely possible that web\u042fcade will not longer be compatible with the updated Xbox Edge browser. Browser Support The recommended browser for use with web\u042fcade on the Xbox is Microsoft Edge. There are other browsers available on the Xbox, but they all appear to use the identical Edge core. Launching web\u042fcade To launch web\u042fcade, perform the following steps: Press the Xbox button on the controller to open the guide on the left side of the screen. Select the \"My games and apps\" option. Select the \"See all\" option. A screen similar to the one shown below should be displayed. Select the \"Apps\" category on the left. Select the \"Microsoft Edge\" application. The \"Microsoft Edge\" browser should be launched and appear similar to the screen above. Use the left analog stick to navigate to the address bar (see screen above). Once the address is highlighted, press the A button. At this point the text entry screen should be displayed (see screen above). Enter the following address: \"play.webrcade.com\" At this point, the web\u042fcade front-end should be displayed (see screen above). The \"Game controls\" input mode should be selected by default, allowing for navigating the front-end via the controller. If this is not the case, refer to the \"Game and Browsing Controls\" section below. Alternate controls The Microsoft Edge application reserves the use of the Menu and View buttons for the context menu and full screen mode operations respectively. Therefore, the following alternative inputs must be used to trigger the Start , Select , and Show Menu actions. Name Gamepad Comments Start and Hold down the Right Trigger and click (press down) on the Right Thumbstick . Select and Hold down the Right Trigger and click (press down) on the Left Thumbstick . Show Menu and Hold down the Left Trigger and click (press down) on the Left Thumbstick . Show Menu (Alternate) and Hold down the Left Trigger and click (press down) on the Right Thumbstick . Game and Browsing Controls Pressing the Menu button on the controller will display a context menu. This menu can be used to switch between Game and Browsing control modes. Game mode is used when navigating the web\u042fcade front-end or playing games. The Browsing mode can be used to access the navigation bar at the top (address, settings, etc.). If the Menu button is pressed when in Game mode, a context menu similar to the one shown in the screen below will be displayed. Selecting the \"Use browsing controls\" option will switch to Browsing mode. If the Menu button is pressed when in Browsing mode, a context menu similar to the one shown in the screen below will be displayed. Selecting the \"Use game controls\" option will switch to Game mode. Full Screen Mode The View button can be used to toggle between \"Full Screen\" and \"Standard\" (with top navigation bar) display modes. The screen below is an example of the Microsoft Edge application in full-screen mode. Pressing the View button when in full-screen mode returns to standard mode. Troubleshooting Unfortunatley, there may be times when web\u042fcade may cease to work correctly within the Microsoft Edge application. The following sections describe various mechanisms that can be used in an attempt to address such issues. Display Guide Sometimes simply opening and closing the Guide menu (press the Xbox button on the controller) can resolve issues. This typically resolves issues such as the View and Menu buttons not responding when being pressed. Refresh Page Another option is to refresh the web\u042fcade page. To refresh the page, perform the following steps: Switch to Browsing mode (See \"Game and Browsing Controls\" section). Use the left analog stick to move the cursor over the Refresh icon in the navigation bar. Press the A button to perform the refrsh. After the page has loaded, press down on the D-pad . This should automatically switch to Game mode and allow for navigation of the web\u042fcade front-end via the controller. Close and Relaunch Edge Another option is to close the Microsoft Edge application and relaunch it. To relaunch the application, perform the following steps: Press the Xbox button on the controller to open the guide on the left side of the screen. Navigate and highlight the Microsoft Edge application. Press the Menu button to display the context menu. Select the Quit option. Select the Microsoft Edge application and press the A button to launch it.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"platforms/xbox/#xbox-series-xs","text":"","title":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"location":"platforms/xbox/#overview","text":"This page provides information on how to obtain the optimal experience when using web\u042fcade with the Xbox Series X|S game consoles.
