The following steps detail the process of adding an NES homebrew game (ROM file) hosted in the Internet Archive to a web\u042fcade feed: The first step is to search for content within the Internet Archive . Although, the Internet Archive does provide its own search mechanism, Google typically provides faster and more accurate search results. To limit the Google search to the Internet Archive, add \" site:archive.org \" after your search critera (see screenshot below). In the example shown below, the full search text is as follows: retro pie homebrew site:archive.org Click on one of the search results to navigate to the corresponding Internet Archive page (see screenshot below). If the Internet Archive page contains downloadable files, a content box titled, \" DOWNLOAD OPTIONS \" should appear on the right side of the page (the page may need to be scrolled to make the content box visible). Click the \" SHOW ALL \" link in the context box to view all of the downloadable files (see screenshot below). Click on the \" View Contents \" link to the right of the ISO file to view its contents (see screenshot below). It is extermely important to descend to the lowest possible level within an archive. There are a number of homebrew collections within the Internet Archive that package multiple-ROM variants in a single zip file. Using a link to the zip file (versus a specific ROM file) will result in much larger downloads with a non-deterministic ROM file being executed. Note The Internet Archive supports descending into various archive file formats (.iso, .zip., etc.). However, It is important to note that although descending into archives may be supported, there exists a bug for certain formats (.7z, etc.) that results in contained content being downloaded as zero bytes (which is unusable). An easy way to validate that a file will be downloaded correctly is to open the link to the file in a new tab. If the downloaded content file size is greater than zero, it is being downloaded correctly. Select a file within the ISO and copy its link address (See screenshot below). In this particular case, the link being copied is for the excellent NES homebrew game, \"Super Uwol!\" by the Mojon Twins. It is also worth noting that in this particular case, the Internet Archive did not provide an opportunity to descend into the .zip file (a \" View Contents \" link was not provided, which would have been preferrable).

It is important to note that while web\u042fcade is functional on previous generations of Xbox One consoles, there will most likely be significant performance issues. Note Support for web\u042fcade on Xbox Series X|S is based on the Xbox Edge browser that utilizes EdgeHTML as its engine. The Xbox Edge browser will be switching to Blink as its browser engine (part of Chromium) in the near future (currently in preview). It is not clear what the impact of the switch to Blink will be on web\u042fcade. It is entirely possible that web\u042fcade will not longer be compatible with the updated Xbox Edge browser. Browser Support The recommended browser for use with web\u042fcade on the Xbox is Microsoft Edge. There are other browsers available on the Xbox, but they all appear to use the identical Edge core. Launching web\u042fcade To launch web\u042fcade, perform the following steps: Press the Xbox button on the controller to open the guide on the left side of the screen. Select the \"My games and apps\" option. Select the \"See all\" option. A screen similar to the one shown below should be displayed. Select the \"Apps\" category on the left. Select the \"Microsoft Edge\" application. The \"Microsoft Edge\" browser should be launched and appear similar to the screen above. Use the left analog stick to navigate to the address bar (see screen above). Once the address is highlighted, press the A button. At this point the text entry screen should be displayed (see screen above). Enter the following address: \"play.webrcade.com\" At this point, the web\u042fcade front-end should be displayed (see screen above). The \"Game controls\" input mode should be selected by default, allowing for navigating the front-end via the controller. If this is not the case, refer to the \"Game and Browsing Controls\" section below. Alternate controls The Microsoft Edge application reserves the use of the Menu and View buttons for the Context Menu and Full Screen Mode operations respectively. Therefore, the following alternative inputs must be used to trigger the Start , Select , and Show Menu actions. Name Gamepad Comments Start and Hold down the Right Trigger and click (press down) on the Right Thumbstick . Select and Hold down the Right Trigger and click (press down) on the Left Thumbstick . Show Menu and Hold down the Left Trigger and click (press down) on the Left Thumbstick . Show Menu (Alternate) and Hold down the Left Trigger and click (press down) on the Right Thumbstick . Game and Browsing Controls Pressing the Menu button on the controller will display a context menu. This menu can be used to switch between Game and Browsing control modes. Game mode is used when navigating the web\u042fcade front-end or playing games. The Browsing mode can be used to access the navigation bar at the top (address, settings, etc.). If the Menu button is pressed when in Game mode, a context menu similar to the one shown in the screen below will be displayed. Selecting the \"Use browsing controls\" option will switch to Browsing mode. If the Menu button is pressed when in Browsing mode, a context menu similar to the one shown in the screen below will be displayed. Selecting the \"Use game controls\" option will switch to Game mode. Full Screen Mode The View button can be used to toggle between \"Full Screen\" and \"Standard\" (with top navigation bar) display modes. The screen below is an example of the Microsoft Edge application in full-screen mode. Pressing the View button when in full-screen mode returns to standard mode. Troubleshooting Unfortunatley, there may be times when web\u042fcade ceases to work correctly within the Microsoft Edge application. The following sections describe various mechanisms that can be used in an attempt to address such issues. Display Guide Sometimes simply opening and closing the Guide menu (press the Xbox button on the controller) can resolve issues. This typically resolves issues such as the View and Menu buttons not responding when being pressed. Refresh Page Another option is to refresh the web\u042fcade page. To refresh the page, perform the following steps: Switch to Browsing mode (See \"Game and Browsing Controls\" section). Use the left analog stick to move the cursor over the Refresh icon in the navigation bar. Press the A button to perform the refresh. After the page has loaded, press down on the D-pad . This should automatically switch to Game mode and allow for navigation of the web\u042fcade front-end via the controller. Close and Relaunch Edge Another option is to close the Microsoft Edge application and relaunch it. To relaunch the application, perform the following steps: Press the Xbox button on the controller to open the guide on the left side of the screen. Navigate and highlight the Microsoft Edge application. Press the Menu button to display the context menu. Select the Quit option.
