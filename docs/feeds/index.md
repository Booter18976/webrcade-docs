# Feeds

This section contains information related to the development of webЯcade feeds. All of the content that is presented within the [webЯcade player](../userguide/index.md) (front-end) is directed by the *currently* loaded feed (only one feed can be loaded at a time). This content includes the images, meta-information (titles, descriptions, etc.), categories, and items (games, etc.) that are available for launching.

See the following pages for detailed information on the development of webЯcade feeds:

* [Feed Editor](../editor/index.md) - The editor provides a simple interface that allows for quickly creating webЯcade feeds without requiring any knowledge of the underlying document format.
* [Feed Resources](./resources/index.md) - Describes in detail, the various resources (cloud-based services, content hosting, etc.) that have been proven to be compatible with the development of webЯcade feeds.
* [Feed Format](./format.md) - Details the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format of a webЯcade feed along with a fully-formed concrete example.
* [Feed Tutorial](./tutorial.md) - Walks through the various steps necessary to create a webЯcade feed manually (versus using the [Feed Editor](../editor/index.md)).
