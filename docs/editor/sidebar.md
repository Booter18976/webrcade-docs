## Actions

The following sections describe in detail the various actions that are located in the "Left Sidebar".

### New Action

The new action initiates the creation of a new feed within the webЯcade editor. After creation, the new feed becomes the *active feed* (the feed currently being edited in the feed workspace) in the editor.

When the "New Action" is clicked, a context menu is displayed containing several options for creating a new feed. The options within the context menu are detailed in the table below.

| __Menu Item__ | __Icon__ | __Description__ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clone example feed | ![](../assets/images/editor/icons/round_file_copy_white_24dp.png){: class="action"} | Creates a copy of the *example feed* (a feed consisting of two categories with three items each) and makes it the *active feed* (the feed currently being edited in the feed workspace). |
| Clone default feed | ![](../assets/images/editor/icons/round_file_copy_white_24dp.png){: class="action"} | Creates a copy of the *default feed* (the default feed for webЯcade comprised of high-quality homebrew across the various application types supported by webЯcade) and makes it the *active feed* (the feed currently being edited in the feed workspace).  |
| Empty feed | ![](../assets/images/editor/icons/round_file_copy_white_24dp.png){: class="action"} | Creates an empty feed comprised of a single category and no items and makes it the *active feed* (the feed currently being edited in the feed workspace). |

### Import Action

The "Import Action" creates a copy of a feed located remotely (via URL) or locally (via a file) and makes it the *active feed* (the feed currently being edited in the feed workspace).

When the "Import Action" is clicked, a dialog is displayed that allows for selecting a remote (via URL) or local (via file) feed. The following two sections describe each of these scenarios.

**Import from URL**
