# Adding Items

One of the predominant uses of the feed editor is adding items (games, etc.) to feeds. To simplify that process, the editor provides multiple methods of adding items which are detailed below. 

## Manual Item Creation

Items can be manually created via the, *Create Item* action, within the [Items Table Toolbar](itemstab.md#items-table). 

Manually creating an item requires more effort than the other options detailed on this page, but it is sometimes necessary if the editor is unable to automatically determine the appropriate application type (emulator, etc.) for a ROM-based URL.

## Add From Dropbox

Items can be created for ROM files that are hosted in your Dropbox account. See the *Add From Dropbox* action in the [Items Table More Menu](itemstab.md#more-menu) for more information.

## Create from ROM URLs

Items can be created and added to feeds based on URLs that point to ROM files. See the *Create from URLs* action in the [Items Table More Menu](itemstab.md#more-menu) for more information.

## Drag and Drop ROM URLs

Items can also be created by dragging and dropping URLs that point to ROM files onto the editor workspace or its dialogs. See the [Drag and Drop ROM URLs](../draganddrop.md#drag-rom-urls) section for more information.
