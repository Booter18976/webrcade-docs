# Feed Workspace

The feed workspace contains several components that provide the ability to view and edit the contents of the active feed. When a feed is "loaded" (imported, etc.) into the workspace, a local copy of the feed is made that persists (is stored locally) between browser sessions.

The workspace is broken into several distinct components which are detailed in the [Components](#components) section below.

One of the primary workspace activities is adding new items (games, etc.) to the active feed. The web–Øcade editor provides several different methods to add items, which are detailed in the [Adding Items](addingitems.md) section. Probably the simplest method of adding items to a feed is by "dragging and dropping" ROM-based URLs onto the workspace (see the [Drag ROMs](../draganddrop.md#dra-roms-urls) section for more information).

## Components

The following table contains the primary components of the feed workspace. Clicking on the name of a *Component* will navigate to a page with detailed information regarding the component.
