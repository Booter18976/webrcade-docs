# Item Editor

The "Item Editor" is used to create and/or edit "Item" entries within a web–Øcade feed. Item entries correspond to items (games, etc.) that can be launched (played, etc.). Each item identifies an application type (the specific emulator or game engine, etc. to launch). The [Applications](../../apps/index.md) page contains a listing of all of the available applications. 

!!! note
    The fields within the "Item Editor" support drag and drop functionality. See the [Drag and Drop](../draganddrop.md) section for more information. Specifically the sections demonstrating how to [Drag Text](../draganddrop.md#drag-text) and [Drag Images](../draganddrop.md#drag-images).

## General Tab

The general tab consists of basic information about the item (title, description, etc.). It also contains an `Application` field which determines the type of emulator or game engine, etc. to utilize when running (playing) the item.
