# Category Editor

The "Category Editor" is used to create and/or edit "category" entries within a web–Øcade feed. Category entries provide a means of classifying items (games, etc.) into user-defined groups
(by game type, console type, etc.). 

For a feed to be considered valid it must contain at least one category object.

  * Categories can be added to the current feed via the [Categories Tab](../workspace/categoriestab.md) of the [Feed Workspace](../workspace/index.md). 
  * Items can be added to categories via the [Items Tab](../workspace/itemstab.md) of the [Feed Workspace](../workspace/index.md).

!!! note
    The fields within the "Category Editor" support drag and drop functionality. See the [Drag and Drop](../draganddrop.md) section for more information. Specifically the sections demonstrating how to [Drag Text](../draganddrop.md#drag-text) and [Drag Images](../draganddrop.md#drag-images).
